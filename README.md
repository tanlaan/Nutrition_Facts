# Nutrition_Facts

The intent for this project is to show the thought process and actions for the subject of taking a data source that can be found in CSV format on the web (USDA Nutrition Facts as an example) through three distinct phases that end up with a fully functional local implementation without any further interactions or limitations imposed by the source itself.
